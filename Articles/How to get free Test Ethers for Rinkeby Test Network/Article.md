# How to get free Test Ethers for Rinkeby Test Network

We need free test ethers while making transactions or to carry out a contract on the Ethereum blockchain because the gas price may not be ecocomical for anyone to purchase. The requested transaction is listed in a prompt by MetaMask, along with the Gas cost and any additional amounts of Ether that would need to be transmitted,  test ethers will be used to cover these costs.
